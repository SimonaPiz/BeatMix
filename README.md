## General Information
### Project Overview

In this project, I wrote functions to implement logic for a beat-making music machine. 

The application can loop over a 16-step grid of four drum types and play them when they are activated. 
  - ✔ [issue #2 - function toggleDrum](https://github.com/SimonaPiz/BeatMix/issues/2)

I also wrote the functionality to invert each row of drums, clear each row of drums, or clear the entire board.
  - ✔ [issue #3 - function clear](https://github.com/SimonaPiz/BeatMix/issues/3)
  - ✔ [issue #4 - function invert](https://github.com/SimonaPiz/BeatMix/issues/4)

Finally, I build the functionality to retrieve and save presets to a server.
  - ✔ [issue #5 - function presetHandler](https://github.com/SimonaPiz/BeatMix/issues/5)

▶ You can view a video demonstration of the final app here: [BeatMix](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/build-apis/solution-videos/BeatMix480.mov)


### Implementation Bonus

As a bonus, I implemented a function to play multiple synthesizer tones at once.
  - ✔ [issue #7 - bonus function](https://github.com/SimonaPiz/BeatMix/issues/7)


### Test Results
  - ✔ [issue #8 - test code](https://github.com/SimonaPiz/BeatMix/issues/8)
